# What is Autism Spectrum Disorder:
- ASD is a neurodevelopmental disability
- There are no medical tests to confirm its presence
- Diagnosis are based on observable characteristics
- Affected age range (0-3]
- The child may develop normally and regress at ~18 months (easier to diagnosis here because of before and after behavioral changes and proofs)

# Behavioral Characteristics of ASD:
- not a diagnostic checklist rather a spectrum of behaviors shown 
- not much to cut short here its a straight forward list of behaviors.

# Medical Tests:
- there are a lot of medical tests but the ones noted are the ones 'suggested' in the book
- **developmental screening** - a face to face interaction with the kid in presence of its parents to observe its behavior and development through a series of questions not limited to pen and paper
- **MRI** - Studies indicate that MRIs may show the differences in the brain resulting from autism
- **EEG** - Again, studies indicate that it is possible to measure the brain waves unique to brain disorders so perhaps the same can be done for autism <- 2014 old news so need to up a bit
- **Metabolic screening** - Blood and urine lab tests measures how a child metabolized food and that is a direct indicator of child's growth thus if a child appears to be regressing this should be considered.
- **Lead level test** - Lead can cause nervous system damage regardless of age so if a child eats dirt or who have pica this test is suggested to them

# DSM V:
- _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition_, is a comprehensive classification system used by mental health professionals to diagnose and classify mental disorders. Published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 2013
- Each mental disorder has specific criteria that help clinicians make accurate diagnoses. The DSM-5 organizes these criteria into clusters for different mental health conditions, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders
- While widely used, the DSM-5 has faced criticism, such as concerns over pathologizing normal behaviors, its emphasis on biomedical models, and the lack of specific biomarkers for certain disorders. However, it remains a fundamental tool in the field.
