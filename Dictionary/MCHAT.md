The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) is a widely used screening tool designed to identify children at risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) between the ages of 16 and 30 months. It consists of a series of simple yes/no questions focused on social communication, behavior, and developmental milestones, which parents or caregivers can complete. The M-CHAT helps detect early signs of autism, allowing for timely referral for further evaluation and early intervention. The checklist is typically administered during routine pediatric checkups, offering an efficient and accessible way to screen large numbers of children for potential autism-related concerns. If a childâ€™s responses raise concerns, a follow-up interview (M-CHAT-R/F) may be conducted to further assess risk and guide the next steps in diagnosis and care.
