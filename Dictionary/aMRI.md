Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (aMRI) is a type of MRI focused on capturing detailed images of brain structures and anatomy. Unlike functional MRI (fMRI), which measures brain activity, aMRI provides high-resolution, static images that reveal brain morphology, such as the size, shape, and volume of different regions. It is commonly used to study the brainâ€™s structural differences, identifying abnormalities or changes in gray and white matter, often applied in research on developmental conditions like autism. By allowing researchers to see precise anatomical details, aMRI helps in understanding brain development and structural variations across different populations. This non-invasive imaging method is fundamental for structural mapping in both clinical and research settings.
