This is a screening tool that is used to assess the presence and severity of ASD in children and adults. The ADOS offers a method of establishing a benchmark of measurement by identifying the shared characteristics found in individuals with autism. This involves evaluating the personâ€™s behavior and communication skills across different social situations. By using this tool, caregivers and experts can determine where an individual falls on the autism spectrum and what interventions would be beneficial to help them receive appropriate assistance.[15](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr15-09731342231223589)
