Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a specialized MRI technique that maps the movement of water molecules along white matter tracts in the brain, providing insights into brain connectivity and structure. By measuring the direction and speed of water diffusion, DTI helps visualize the pathways of neural fibers, revealing the integrity and organization of white matter, which is crucial for brain communication. This method is especially valuable in studying developmental and neurological disorders, such as autism, as it identifies differences in brain connectivity that might underlie behavioral and cognitive characteristics. DTI is non-invasive and produces highly detailed images that researchers and clinicians use to study structural connectivity patterns. Itâ€™s widely used for research on brain maturation, injury, and conditions affecting neural pathways.
