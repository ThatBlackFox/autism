The Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) is a screening tool used to assess autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children over the age of 4, based on their social and communication behaviors. The SCQ consists of 40 yes/no questions, divided into two sections: one focusing on early developmental history and the other on current behavior. It is designed to be completed by parents or caregivers, providing a quick and effective way to identify children who may need further evaluation for ASD. The responses are scored to determine the likelihood of ASD, with higher scores indicating a greater need for a comprehensive diagnostic assessment. The SCQ is particularly useful for large-scale screening and can help guide clinicians in deciding whether further diagnostic testing or intervention is warranted.
