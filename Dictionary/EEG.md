Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method used to measure electrical activity in the brain. It involves placing electrodes on the scalp to detect the electrical signals generated by neurons firing. EEG is primarily used in diagnosing neurological conditions like epilepsy, sleep disorders, and brain injuries. The signals recorded by EEG are displayed as waveforms, which can be analyzed to assess brain function and detect abnormalities. Different brain states, such as alertness, relaxation, or sleep, can be identified by observing the patterns of these brainwave frequencies.
