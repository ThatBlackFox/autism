The Childhood Autism Screening Instrument (CASI) is a tool designed to help identify signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in young children. It is a standardized, structured instrument that assesses a childâ€™s behavior and developmental milestones to screen for possible autism. The CASI is used by healthcare professionals, typically in clinical settings, to observe and evaluate various behavioral and communication patterns that may indicate autism. The screening process involves a series of questions related to the child's social interactions, language development, and play behavior, and it aims to provide early detection, which is crucial for effective intervention. The CASI is valuable in facilitating early referral for diagnostic assessment and ensuring timely therapeutic support for children showing signs of autism.
