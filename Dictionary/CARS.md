The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is an assessment tool used to evaluate the presence and severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children. It helps clinicians determine the degree of autism symptoms in children aged 2 years and older. The scale consists of 15 behavioral items, such as social communication, sensory sensitivities, and repetitive behaviors, which are rated on a scale from 1 (no evidence of autism) to 4 (severe symptoms). The ratings are based on direct observation and input from parents or caregivers, with a total score that indicates the severity of the disorder: lower scores suggest mild symptoms, while higher scores suggest more severe autism. CARS is widely used for diagnostic purposes and to help guide treatment and intervention planning, providing a structured and standardized way to assess children with ASD.
