Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. When specific brain areas are more active, they require more oxygen, which fMRI detects through changes in the magnetic properties of blood. Unlike traditional MRI, which captures static images of brain structures, fMRI provides dynamic images showing which brain regions are engaged during tasks or at rest. fMRI is widely used in research on cognitive functions, emotions, and disorders, including autism, as it helps map neural activity associated with specific functions. Its non-invasive nature makes it a powerful tool for studying brain function in real time.
