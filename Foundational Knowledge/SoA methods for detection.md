- **Functional MRI (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)**:
    
    - **fMRI** measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. It helps identify atypical brain connectivity patterns associated with autism.
    - **DTI** is a type of MRI that maps white matter tracts and reveals abnormalities in brain communication pathways common in autistic individuals.
- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**:
    
    - EEG measures electrical activity in the brain and can detect atypical brainwave patterns associated with autism. Advances in machine learning are improving EEG’s sensitivity to subtle neurological markers of ASD, making it a non-invasive, cost-effective option for early screening.
- **Eye-Tracking Technology**:
    
    - Eye-tracking devices measure visual attention patterns, which can reveal social and emotional processing differences in children with autism. For instance, reduced eye contact or atypical responses to facial expressions can be early indicators.
    - Companies like _Cognoa_ and _Eyetracker_ use AI to analyze gaze patterns, providing quantifiable data to support autism diagnosis.
- **Digital Behavior Analysis Tools**:
    
    - Digital tools like **Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid** analyze videos of children’s behavior submitted by parents. Algorithms analyze interactions, movement patterns, and other behaviors to provide preliminary ASD assessments.
    - These tools can be especially helpful in reducing wait times for traditional assessments, which can be lengthy.
- **Biomarker Research and Genetic Testing**:
    
    - Biomarkers (like proteins or metabolites in the blood) and genetic tests are becoming valuable in identifying risk factors associated with ASD. Some companies are developing saliva or blood tests that detect autism-linked genes or protein markers.
    - Genetic tests like **Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA)** and **Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)** help identify genetic mutations linked to ASD, though they are used as supplementary tools alongside behavioral assessments.
- **Machine Learning and AI-Powered Tools**:
    
    - Machine learning models analyze large datasets of behavioral, genetic, and imaging data to predict ASD with higher accuracy. Some tools even combine multiple data sources, like medical records and early screening test results, to assess risk factors and help doctors make data-driven decisions.
- **ADOS-2 (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition)**:
    
    - Though not new, ADOS-2 remains the gold standard in autism diagnosis. Combined with AI algorithms, ADOS-2 assessments are being streamlined to offer faster and sometimes remote evaluations, making it easier to assess developmental and social responses.

_[[INCLEN-INDT]] (Indian Network for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics—Indian Diagnostic Tool for ASD):_ It is specifically designed for use in India. It is a comprehensive assessment tool that evaluates a child’s developmental, behavioral, and social skills to determine if they meet the criteria for ASD. It is a culturally appropriate tool that takes into account the diverse population of India and has been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting ASD.[10](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr10-09731342231223589)

_[[CASI]]:_ It is a screening tool that is used to identify children who may be at risk of ASD. It is a parent-completed questionnaire that assesses a child’s communication, social interaction, and play skills. It is a quick and easy-to-administer tool with good sensitivity and specificity for detecting ASD in young children.[11](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr11-09731342231223589)

_[Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and M-CHAT Follow-up Interview](MCHAT.md):_ It is used to assess the risk of ASD in children aged 16 to 30 months. The M-CHAT is a 23-item questionnaire that is completed by parents or caregivers. If an individual receives a positive score on the screening test, they have a follow-up interview before deciding whether they need a referral.[12](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr12-09731342231223589)

[_Childhood Autism Rating Scale](CARS.md) (CARS):_ It is used to assess the severity of ASD in children. The CARS is a 15-item questionnaire that is completed by a trained professional. It is done by rating the child’s behavior, characteristics, and abilities against the expected developmental growth of a typical child.[13](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr13-09731342231223589)

[_Social Communication Questionnaire](SCQ.md) (SCQ):_ It is used to assess the risk of ASD in children aged 4 years and older. The SCQ is a 40-item questionnaire which is also completed by parents/caregivers.[14](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr14-09731342231223589)

_[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule](ADOS.md) (ADOS):_ This is a screening tool that is used to assess the presence and severity of ASD in children and adults. The ADOS offers a method of establishing a benchmark of measurement by identifying the shared characteristics found in individuals with autism. This involves evaluating the person’s behavior and communication skills across different social situations. By using this tool, caregivers and experts can determine where an individual falls on the autism spectrum and what interventions would be beneficial to help them receive appropriate assistance.[15](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr15-09731342231223589)

_[Indian Scale for Assessment of Autism ](ISAA.md)(ISAA):_ This is a screening tool that has been developed specifically for use in India. The ISAA is a comprehensive assessment tool that includes both observational and interview-based components. It consists of 40 items which are divided under 6 domains: social relationship and reciprocity, emotional responsiveness; speech—language and communication, behavior patterns, sensory aspects, and cognitive component.[16](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr16-09731342231223589)

The diagnosis of ASD in India is challenging due to the lack of awareness and understanding of the disorder among the general population. Additionally, there is a lack of resources, lack of trained professionals, and language and cultural barriers, which hinders the screening and diagnosis process.[17](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09731342231223589#bibr17-09731342231223589)
