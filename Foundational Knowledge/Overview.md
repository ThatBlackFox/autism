# [What is Autism Spectrum Disorder](Foundational#What is Autism Spectrum Disorder)

ASD is considered a neurodevelopmental disability, meaning that it affects the function of the brain. Autism typically appears during the first three years of life and is thought to be four times more prevalent in males than in females.

There's no medical test to diagnose for ASD. Any diagnosis is based on observable characteristics, that is, the behavior that a person is exhibiting

Because of the nature of the symptoms, ASD is sometimes difficult to diagnose at a very early age. If the child is their first, the parents haven o experiences with which to compare. Seeing other toddlers and children develop differently, they may start to worry.

Sometimes parents will talk to their doctor about their concerns regarding the child's lack of verbal communication and eye contact, his failure to respond to his name and his obsessive attachment to certain objects.

In many cases, a baby will develop normally and then start to regress at around eighteen months. These children are usually easier to diagnose because of the obvious difference in past and present behaviors to which parents and professionals can attest from looking at photos, watching videos, and comparing observations.

Often the parents may be concerned because their child is a walking encyclopedia on a particular topic (such as trains), plays obsessively in the same way with the same toy, or will eat only certain foods. Perhaps it is the kindergarten teacher who notices that he does not appear to engage in conversation with his classmates and has a difficult time with any change in routine. Or a child may be considered “naughty” at school because of certain behaviors, and perhaps the parents haven’t noticed anything amiss because he is an only child, or they think that boys mature less quickly than girls. This may be true, but it is better to be sure and investigate your concerns.

# [Behavioral Characteristics of ASD](Foundational#Behavioral Characteristics of ASD )


A word of caution: This list is not meant to be a diagnostic checklist, but is intended to give you some ideas of the types of behaviors someone with autism may exhibit. Remember, it is the number and severity of these behaviors that may lead to talks with a professional about performing a diagnostic assessment

Some of these behaviors are seen on one end of the spectrum (e.g., classic autism), others on the opposite end (e.g., high-functioning autism, or what was labeled “Asperger’s syndrome” prior to the release of the DSM-V in May 2013).

## IMPAIRMENT OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION

- As a baby, does not reach out to be held by mother or seek cuddling
- Does not imitate others
- Uses adult as a means to get wanted object, without interacting with adult as a person

- communication such as pointing and gesturing
- Has speech, then loses it
- Repeats words or phrases instead of using normal language (echolalia)
- Speaks on very narrowly focused topics

- Does not like change in routine or environment (going to a different
- place, furniture moved in house)
- Will eat only certain foods
- Will use only the same object (same plate or cup, same clothes)
- Repetitive motor movements (rocking, hand flapping)
## OTHER CHARACTERISTICS

- Peculiar voice characteristics (flat monotone or high pitch)
- Does not reach developmental milestones in neurotypical time frame or
- sequence
- Low muscle tone
- Uneven fine and gross motor skills
- Covers ears

- Becomes hyperactive or totally nonresponsive in noisy or very bright environments
- Eats or chews on unusual things
- Puts objects to nose to smell them
- Removes clothes often
- Hits or bites self (hits head or slaps thighs or chest)
- Whirls himself like a top
- Has temper tantrums for no apparent reason and is difficult to calm down
- Hits or bites others
- Lacks common sense
- Does not appear to understand simple requests
- Frequent diarrhea, upset stomach, or constipation

# [Medical Tests](Foundational#Medical Tests)


The following are suggest medical tests for the purpose of assessing a child with autism and elimination other possible reasons for the person's behavior

## Developmental screening:

During routine well-child visits, development screening is a way to tell if a child is learning basic skills when he or she should be. During developmental screening the doctor observes and interacts with the child, and asks the parent questions. The doctor is looking to see how the child learns, speaks, behaves, and moves and if the child has reached his developmental milestones or not. A delay in any area could be a sign of a problem. When such a screening—or a parent—raises concerns about a child’s development, the doctor should refer the child to a specialist in developmental evaluation and early intervention. These evaluations should include hearing and lead exposure tests as well as an autism-specific screening tool, such as the M-CHAT.

## MRI:

Magnetic sensing equipment creates, in extremely fine detail, an image of the brain. Many advancements continue to be made in this technology. At the time of this writing, MRIs are not used for screening for autism, although some research indicates that MRIs may show differences in the brain resulting from autism

## Electroencephalogram (EEG):

An EEG can detect tumors or other brain abnormalities. It also measures brain waves that can show seizure disorders. At the time of this writing, there is research indicating that EEGs may become a useful tool for detecting autism.

## Genetic testing:

There is a gene test that uses a cheek swab to screen infants and toddlers for sixty-five genetic markers associated with autism. This test was developed to be used by families who already have one child with autism. However, at the time of this writing, this test only identifies an estimated 10 percent of possible genetic markers. Technology is improving in this area.

## Metabolic screening:

Blood and urine lab tests measure how a child metabolizes food and its impact on growth and development. In particular, these should be considered when a child appears to be regressing, or other clinical evidence shows there might be a problem.

## Lead level test:

Children who have pica (eating nonnutritive substances, such as dirt) should have their lead levels checked.

# [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)](Foundational#DSM V:)


Under the definition of “autism” in the DSM-IV, patients were **diagnosed under four separate disorders: autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, or pervasive developmental** disorder not otherwise specified. In the DSM-V, these separate disorders do not exist. This has created some controversy among parents and professionals in the autism community, especially with regard to removing Asperger’s syndrome as a disorder. Those involved with rewriting the DSM-V definition believe that the individuals diagnosed with one of the four pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) from DSM-IV should still meet the criteria for ASD in DSM-V or another, more accurate DSM-V diagnosis.

In the DSM-V, the diagnostic criteria for ASD is the following:
	1. Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction
	across multiple contexts in areas described below, that the individual
	currently displays or did in the past:
		a. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity (for example, failure to
		carry on a back-and-forth conversation, failure to initiate or
		respond to social interaction, not having appropriate social
		approach behaviors).
		b. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social
		interactions (for example, abnormalities in eye contact and body
		language, lack of facial expressions).
		c. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding
		relationships (for example, difficulties in adjusting behavior to
		suit various contexts, difficulties in sharing imaginative play or
		making friends).
	2. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities as
	demonstrated by two of the following, that the individual currently
	displays or did in the past:
		a. Stereotyped or repetitive motor behaviors, use of objects, or
		speech (for example, lining up toys, echolalia).
		b. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or
		ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal speech (for example,
		difficulties in moments of transition, insistence on same food).
		c. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity
		or focus (for example, strong preoccupation with or attachment
		to unusual interests or objects).
		d. Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in
		sensory aspects of the environment (for example, does not appear
		to feel extreme cold or heat, excessive touching or smelling of
		objects).

It is important to recognize that for a diagnosis of ASD to be given:
1. The symptoms must be present in the early developmental period;
2. The symptoms must be severe enough to cause clinically significant
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning; and
3. The symptoms would not be better explained by intellectual
disability or global developmental disability.

# [Comorbidity:](Foundational%20Key%20Takeaways.md#Comorbidity)

A person may be diagnosed with ASD and still have other existing medical or psychiatric conditions. In medical terms, “comorbidity” is the presence of one or more conditions along with the primary diagnosis. Research indicates that 70 percent of individuals with autism also have one or more comorbid mental disorders, and 40 percent may have two or more comorbid mental disorders, according to the DSM-V. For example, an individual with a diagnosis of autism could well have ADHD, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders. If an individual with autism is nonverbal or has low communication skills, observable signs, such as changes in eating and sleeping or increases in challenging behaviors, should be considered as possible signs of depression or anxiety.
