### Asperger’s syndrome

[Asperger’s syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/asperger-syndrome) was on the mild end of the spectrum. People with Asperger’s were often considered “high functioning,” with average-to-above-average intelligence and without speech delays. Some autistic people object to the terms “high functioning” or “low functioning.”

Signs and symptoms included:

- having impairment in social interaction
- trouble reading facial expressions, body language, and social cues
- not understanding irony, metaphor, or humor
- showing awkward body language, standing too close, or talking too loudly
- lacking eye contact
- repeating the same behaviors and activities

Note that all these symptoms above and below can also apply to ASD. The main difference between Asperger’s syndrome and autism is the less severe symptoms and the lack of language delays in Asperger’s syndrome.

Children who were given an Asperger’s label may have more subtle differences, and they frequently have strong language and cognitive skills.

To others, these can be interpreted as signs of rudeness, so forming friendships can be challenging. Other signs included:

- clumsiness
- poor handwriting
- narrow range of interests or preoccupation with a single interest
- repetitive behaviors
- need for routine and rigid rules
- easily upset when things don’t go as planned

### Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)

The diagnosis of [PDD-NOS](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/pdd-nos) was given when a developmental disorder didn’t quite meet the criteria for autism, Asperger’s syndrome, Rett syndrome, or childhood disintegrative disorder.

PDD-NOS was also called “atypical autism.”

Signs of PDD-NOS included:

- deficits in social behavior
- uneven skill development
- poorly developed speech and language
- difficulty accepting change
- uncommon responses to taste, sight, sound, smell, or touch
- repetitive or ritualistic behaviors
- highly restricted and focused interests

These symptoms can apply to ASD now.

### Autistic disorder

Autistic disorder was considered on the more severe end of the spectrum. You’d likely see more noticeable symptoms early on. These involve:

- challenges with social interaction
- communication problems
- repetitive behaviors

Other signs included:

- tantrums or “[meltdowns](https://www.healthline.com/health/autism/what-to-do-autism-meltdown)“
- sleeping and eating disturbances

Children who were on the severe end of the spectrum may have preferred playing alone and had difficulty interacting with peers. A high level of support was needed for them.

### Childhood disintegrative disorder

A child with this disorder met normal developmental milestones for the first few years. After that, there was a rapid decline in acquired skills involving:

- language and communication
- social skills, play, and self-care skills
- motor skills, and bowel and bladder control

Childhood disintegrative disorder fell on the severe end of the spectrum.

### Rett syndrome

Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder that occurs most often in girls, more rarely in boys, and leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child’s life: their ability to speak, walk, eat, and even breathe easily. The hallmark of Rett syndrome is near constant repetitive hand movements. Rett syndrome is usually recognized in children between 6 to 18 months as they begin to miss developmental milestones or lose abilities they had gained.

Rett syndrome is caused by mutations on the X chromosome on a gene called MECP2. There are more than 900 different mutations found on the MECP2 gene, most found in eight different “hot spots.” Rett syndrome is not a degenerative disorder with individuals living to middle age or beyond. Rett syndrome occurs worldwide in 1 of every 10,000 female births and is even rarer in boys. Rett syndrome can present with a wide range of disability ranging from mild to severe. The course and severity of Rett syndrome is determined by the location, type and severity of the mutation and X-inactivation.

### Symptoms may include:

- Loss of speech
- Loss of purposeful use of hands
- Involuntary hand movements such as handwashing
- Loss of mobility or gait disturbances
- Loss of muscle tone
- Seizures or Rett “episodes”
- Scoliosis
- Breathing issues
- Sleep disturbances
- Slowed rate of growth for head, feet and hands
